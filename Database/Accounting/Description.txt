Our company has a number of clients and accounts. To modernize our accounting system, we need an api to manage our clients and their current balances.

Please see the attached database, sample data and structure. 
There are two tables, accounts and transactions. There is a many-one relationship between accounts and transactions.
There are DEBIT transactions which increase the balance, and CREDIT transactions which decrease the account balance.
There is an initial 'DEBIT' transaction which represents the opening transaction for the account, and some accounts have corresponding 'CREDIT' transactions.

Endpoints needed:
- Retrieve an existing account by id, with corresponding balances.
- Add a transaction to the ledger, and update the account balance.
- Retrieve transactions for account
